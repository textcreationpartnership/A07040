            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Surely, otherwi≈øe they ≈øhould doe me great iniurie, and ≈øhewe, that they are tho≈øe who delight neither in heate nor colde, and ≈øo make me as weary in ≈øeeking howe to fitte them as the Bi≈øhops are in labouring how to find me. The Bi≈øhops I feare are pa≈øt my cure, and it may be I was vnwi≈øe, in taking that charge vpon me: if that which I haue already done can do them any good, or any wi≈øe further the cau≈øe which I loue, I ≈øhall be glad, if not, what hope is there of amending them this way? The be≈øt is I know how to mend my ≈øelfe. For good leaue haue I to giue ouer my de≈øparate cure, and with this my farewell vnto them, I wi≈øh them a better Surgeon. Yet ere I leaue them, I do heere offer vnto the view of the world, ≈øome part of their mon≈øtrous corruptions; in defence whereof, for their liues dare not they in any learned meeting or a≈ø≈øembly di≈øpute with with me, or attempt to ouerthrowe mine a≈ø≈øerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by mode≈øt writings handled any thing ≈øcholer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb facs="tcp:12605:3"/>that is, by good and ≈øounde ≈øyllogi≈ømes, which haue both their Maior and Minor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the worde. I woulde once ≈øee them enter into either of the≈øe cour≈øes, for as yet they haue beene farre from both. Fire, and fagot, bands, and blowes, railing, and reuiling, are, and haue bene hitherto their common weapons, as for ≈ølandering &amp; lying, it is the greate≈øt piece of their holy profe≈ø≈øion. And the≈øe with their bare a≈ø≈øerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, &amp; their wretched cleuing to popi≈øh ab≈øurdities, are in a maner the onely proofes and tried max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes they offer vnto the Church in this age. And ≈øo if a man woulde be confuted, I mu≈øt needes ≈øay, my Lord of Winche≈øter hath long agoe ≈øufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dexterely performed it. <hi>I am not of opinion,</hi> (≈øaith he) that, <hi>vna ≈øemper debet e≈ø≈øe oeconomia Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiae,</hi> That the gouernement of the Church ≈øhoulde alwayes, and in all places, bee one and the ≈øame, e≈øpecially by a company of Elders.

As for my Lord of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che≈øters
<hi>opinion,</hi> wee haue little or nothing to doe with that: nor no great matter which ≈øide it leane to, whether with or again≈øt the trueth. For if his bi≈øhopricke and vnruly iuri≈ødiction were no more noy≈øome and hurtfull to the Church of God, then his learning and opinion is hurtfull to the cau≈øe of Di≈øcipline, he might ≈øitte long enough vndi≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in his chaire for vs: the good olde manne might cough his fill, and be quiet, hauing his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<pb facs="tcp:12605:3"/>promi≈øe and booke-oth (as we haue al≈øo Iohn a Bridges and Bancrofts) that by arguments hee will neuer hurt vs. For they mu≈øt thinke, that it is not ≈øuch drie blowes as this, <hi>I am not of opinion, &amp;c.</hi> that will ≈øatisfie the learned, and an≈øweare the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrations that are brought on the contrarie ≈øide.

            <p n="1">1 THat al the officers of a true &amp; lawful church gouernement in regarde of their offices, are members of the vi≈øible bodie of Chri≈øt, which is the Church. Rom. 12.4,5. &amp;c. 1. Cor. 12.8,28.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That none but Chri≈øt alone is to ordeine the members of his bodie, to wit, of the Church: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:12605:4"/>3 That the Lorde in his worde hath left the church perfect in all her members, which he ≈øhold nor haue done, if he had not ordeined all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, namely, the members thereof, and ≈øo hee ≈øhould leaue the building of his church vnperfect, and ≈øo it mu≈øt continue, for who wil pre≈øume to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh that which hee hath left vndone in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That to ordeine a perfect and an vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gouernement of the Church, is, a part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtes prerogatiue royall, and therfore cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the great derogation of the Sonne of God; bee claimed by any Church or man.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That if Chri≈øt did not ordeine a Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, which at the plea≈øure of man can not be changed, then hee is inferiour vnto Mo≈øes, for the gouernment placed by him might no man to alter, and thereto might no man adde any thing. Heb. 3.2,3.</p>

            <p n="11">11 That the want of the≈øe can bee no maime vnto the church, ≈øeeing the Lorde by remoouing them thence, ≈øheweth, that the body can haue no v≈øe of them.</p>

            <head>Martin Iuniors Epilogue. To the wor≈øhipfull his very good neame, Mai≈øter Iohn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turburie.</head>
            <p>AFter my harty commendations vnto your VVorshippe, (good nunckle Canturbury) tru≈øting, that you, vvith the re≈øt of the Cater-caps are as neere your ouerthrovve, as Jyour poore nephevv am from vvishing the pro≈øperitie of your Antichri≈øtian callings. The cau≈øe of my vvriting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you at this in≈øtant, is, to let you vnderstand, fir≈øt, that I vvas ≈øomevvhat merry at the making heereof, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ≈øory, together vvith others of my brethren, that vvee cannot heare from our good father, Maister Martin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate, that good &amp; learned di≈øcour≈øing brother of yours, but e≈øpecially grieued, that vve ≈øee not the vtter ≈øubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of that vnhappy and pe≈øtilent gouernement of L. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, at the helme vvhereof ye ≈øitte like a Pilate, or a Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas rather. Moreouer, I do you to vveete, that you shal receiue by this bearer, certaine vnperfect vvritings of my fathers, praying your prelacie, if you can ≈øend mee, or any of my brethren any vvord of him, that you vvould returne vs an an≈øvvere vvith ≈øpeede.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12605:11"/>MAny flim flam tales goe abroad of him, but of certaintie nothing can be heard, in as much as he keepeth him ≈øelfe ≈øecrete from all his ≈øonnes. Some thinke, that hee is euen nowe employed in your bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; and I thinke ≈øo too, my rea≈øon is, quoth Robert Some, becau≈øe it was for your ≈øakes and good, that hee fir≈øt fell a ≈øtudying the Arte of Pi≈øtle making: Others giue out, that in the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his countrey, and her Maie≈øties, he died, or was in great danger at the Groine. And the others (ka mine vncka Bridges) haue ≈øeene motiues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to be of this minde: Some there are al≈øo, who feare that you haue him in your handes. How≈øoeuer it be ≈øomewhat is not well, that hee is ≈øilent all this while. We his ≈øonnes mu≈øt needes be di≈øquieted, ≈øeeing wee can neither knowe where our father is, nor yet heare from him. If we could but heere by ≈øome Pi≈øtle, though it were but of 20. ≈øheetes of paper, that he is well, we would not then be ≈øo inqui≈øitiue of him. But now that he hath bin ≈øo long time tongue-tied the≈øe foure or fiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, wee mu≈øt needes enquire of the matter. Speake then, good nuncles, haue you clo≈øly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the gentlman in ≈øome of your pri≈øons? haue you ≈øtrangled him? haue you giuen him an Italian figge? or, what haue you done vnto him? haue you choaked him with a fat prebend or two? What? I trowe my father wil ≈øwallow downe no ≈øuch pilles. And he doe, I can tell he will ≈øoone purge away al the con≈øcience hee hath, and prooue a mad hinde ere he die. But tell me, I pray you, what you meane to doe vnto him if you haue him in holde? Do you meane to haue the keeping of him, lea≈øt he ≈øhould not be otherwi≈øe well looked vnto? whie what need<pb facs="tcp:12605:12"/>tat? I am ≈øure he hath 500. ≈øonnes in the lande, of good credit and abilitie, with whome hee might haue other gates welcome, then with any Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap o them all. And I pray you, nunckles, neuer trouble your ≈øelues with the keeping of him, I tru≈øt he ≈øhal do well, though he neuer come neere any of you all. And I thinke in rea≈øon it were more meete his ≈øonnes, then his brethren ≈øhoulde bee charged with him; if it ≈øo came to pa≈ø≈øe, that hee were forced to leane vnto others. This I knowe full well, that my father woulde bee ≈øory from his heart, to put you to any ≈øuch co≈øt, as you intend to bee at with him. A meaner hou≈øe, and of le≈ø≈øe ≈øtrength then the Tower, the Fleete, Newgate, or the Gate-hou≈øe is, woulde ≈øerue him well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: he is not of that ambitious vaine, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his brethren the bi≈øhops are, in ≈øeeking for more co≈øtly hou≈øes then euer his father built for him. And therefore, good ≈øweete neames nowe, if you haue him, let him bee di≈øpatched out of your hands, with hone≈øty and credit. My father is of a kingly nature I perceiue by him, hee woulde doe good vnto you, but he would not be recompenced for it againe. He will none of your courte≈øies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe it be for your owne ≈øakes, that you will giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your bi≈øhopdomes, that is the greate≈øt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite he accounts of from you, other recompence he ≈øeekes none.</p>
            <p>If you demaund of mee, where I founde this, the trueth is, it was taken vp (together with certaine other papers) be≈øides a bu≈øh, where it had drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from ≈øome body pa≈ø≈øing by that way. I hope my fathers wor≈øhip will not bee oftended with me, for publi≈øhing of it, being not ≈øo perfit as que≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe<pb facs="tcp:12605:12"/>he would haue had it. Hee, and you, can not but commend my good dealing, in ≈øetting it out; for I cho≈øe rather to leaue the ≈øentences vnperfite then to adde any thing more then I found legible. The Arithmeticall nombers in the end of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble ≈øhew, that when he had written ≈øo farre, he had ≈øomething more in his head then all men doe conceiue, which made him leaue in the midde≈øt of a period. I my ≈øelfe doe perceiue ≈øome tanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>clu≈øions as being the fir≈øt draught, but I would not pre≈øume to mend them, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to him≈øelfe, if he be yet liuing, if dead, yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterities may haue his after-birth to be altogether his owne. And let them take this as his <hi>cygncam cantionem,</hi> viz. his farewell to booke-making. But that would I be ≈øorie of. For who can bee able to prooue the poynts which he hath ≈øet downe here, concerning the doctrine of our church, mainter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ≈øtatur, &amp; her Maie≈øties priuiledge, ≈øo ≈øound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ≈øo worthily, as he him≈øelfe would performe it. A thirtie or fortie of the fir≈øt Conclu≈øions are alreadie ≈øhewed in, Hai any work for the Cooper, and therefore they neede no further proofe then the reading ouer that woorthie Treati≈øe, whence they ≈øeeme to haue beene collected. The re≈øt I hope ≈øhall be ≈øhewed in More worke for the Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>And vather, if you can proue the≈øe thinges out of the doctrine of our church, then certainelie you de≈øerue to be chronicled for euer. Then Iohn Canturbury, come downe with thy poperie, ka M. Martin Iunior: for now art thou ≈øet out in thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, to be an aduer≈øary, not onely of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, which all men might know, but euen<pb facs="tcp:12605:13"/>al≈øo an vtter enemie vnto the doctrine of the church of England ≈øowed heere by the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, and ≈øealed with their blood, yea, allowed by ≈øtatute, and publi≈øhed with her Maie≈øties royall priuiledge, which is a point that the mo≈øt haue not con≈øidered of. And who is hee now that dares per≈øwade Martin to giue ouer his cour≈øe, vnle≈ø≈øe the ≈øame al≈øo will ≈øhewe him≈øelfe an enemie to the doctrine of the church of England. For Martin in his writings, is not ≈øo much an ennemie vnto the bi≈øhoppes, as a defender of the doctrine of our Churche. And therefore you Puritanes, that mi≈ølike of him, take heede that you bee not founde amonge≈øt po≈øterities, to bee the betrayers of this doctrine (for your ea≈øe and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etne≈ø≈øe ≈øake) which you are bound to deliuer vnto your children, without corruption or mangling, though it co≈øt you your liues a thou≈øande times<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> For to tell you the trueth, if you do but read ouer the writings of M. Tindall, M. Frith, M. Barnes, M. Hooper, M. Knox, M. Lambert, &amp;c. which were the fir≈øt planters of the Go≈øpell amonge≈øt vs, you ≈øhall find your ≈øelues in faithfulnes, courage and zeale, yea, euen the be≈øt of you farre behind them; which I ≈øpeake not but to your great ≈øhame, with a de≈øire of your amendement. And therefore I tell you true, I thinke it a great ble≈ø≈øing of God that hath rai≈øed vppe this Martin, whome you can hardelie brooke, to holde tackling with the bi≈øhops, that you may haue ≈øome time of breathing, or rather a time to gather courage and zeale, ioyned with knowledge, to ≈øet vpon the≈øe enemies of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our church, euen the doctrine of God, I meane maintained in our church. For that as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto<pb facs="tcp:12605:13"/>ye haue done, you be ≈øo loth (for the di≈øtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of our ≈øtate for≈øooth, and the offending of hir Maie≈øtie) not onely to ≈øpeake again≈øt, but euen vtterlie to reiect this hierarchie of our bi≈øhops, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to haue no more to doe with it, then with the ≈øeate of the bea≈øt, you ≈øhall declare vnto our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that God rai≈øed vppe but a companie of whiteliuered ≈øouldiours, to teach the Go≈øpell in ≈øinceritie vnder her Maie≈øtie, and take heede le≈øt our forenamed fathers ri≈øe vppe in iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt you. As for her Maie≈øtie, or the ≈øtate, I think ≈øhee hath little cau≈øe to thanke you for your wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in ≈øeeking the quietne≈ø≈øe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, by-winking at the ≈øinne of the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous mini≈øterie. And me thinkes you are bounde vnto her, and her people, to make ≈øo much at the lea≈øt knowen, as ≈øhee mainteineth publikelie in bookes, by her ≈øtatutes and priuiledges, to be the doctrine of this our church vnder her gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore, looke vnto the≈øe thinges, for certainelie, if euer the Lorde ≈øhall make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of our wicked bi≈øhoppes knowen vnto her Maie≈øtie, to bee ≈øo contrarie to worde of God, the profe≈ø≈øion of holie Martyres, and the doctrine of our church mainteined, both by our ≈øtatutes, and priuiledges, as in the≈øe The≈øes they are ≈øette downe, a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelfe, that ≈øhe will then enquire, whether ≈øhe had not any faithfull preachers in her kingdome, that would ≈øtand to the defence of the trueth, vntill ≈øhee ≈øawe further into it.</p>
            <p>As for the bi≈øhops, they may herein ≈øee, to their woe, what wicked caytiffes they are, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them≈øelues &amp; their thrice cur≈ø≈øed popedome,<pb facs="tcp:12605:14"/>again≈øt ≈øuch cleare light. But the bea≈øtes, I feare, were borne to no other end, then to be the Lords ≈øcourge, to cha≈øtice his church, and then to bee burnt in hell. And out vppon them, they are as vnlike Chri≈øt, his Apo≈øtles, and holy Martyres, which were the planters of our Churche, as the wretches are like vnto them≈øelues. A man would haue thought, if they had not beene de≈øperate in their wickedne≈ø≈øe, that by the warning which Martin gaue them, they woulde haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained from their villanie in ≈øome ≈øort. But, as though their very rea≈øon had bene cleane gone, the more they are threatned to haue their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings di≈øplayed, the more wicked doe they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt them≈øelues. As if they woulde declare vnto the worlde, that they will not bee made knowen vnto po≈øteritie, but vppon the condition, that they may bee the mo≈øt wicked, that euer were in the church of God. They will be ≈øo many Iuda≈øes, ≈øo many Diotrephe≈øes, ≈øo many Simon Magu≈øes, as nowe they are wicked bi≈øhoppes of Englande, or el≈øe they thinke not them≈øelues well dealte with. Wherefore, reuerend father, if you bee as yet on your feete, and haue e≈øcaped out of the danger of gunne ≈øhotte, beginne againe to play the man. Feare none of the≈øe bea≈øtes, the≈øe pur≈øuvants, the≈øe Mar-Martins, the≈øe ≈øtage-players, the≈øe prelates, the≈øe popes, the≈øe diuels, and al they can do. Quit your ≈øelfe but as like a man as you haue doone in Hai any worke, and I doubt not but you will make the≈øe rogi≈øh prie≈øts lie in the kenell. The reporte abroad goeth, that you are drawen drie, and can ≈øay no more. They are fooles that ≈øo thinke, I ≈øay,<pb facs="tcp:12605:14"/>Let the≈øe Conclu≈øions bee iudge, whereby I tell you true, I hope you ≈øhall be able to emprie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bi≈øhopricke in Englande, if waight of tructh can doe it. There bee that affirme, the rimers and ≈øtage-players, to haue cleane putte you out of countenaunce, that you dare not againe ≈øhew your face. Alas poore haglers, their fathers are too yoong to outface the lea≈øt of your ≈øonnes. And I doe thinke, that, lay a≈øide their tyrannie, all the bi≈øhops of Englande are too weake to deale with a ≈øcarre-crowe, that hath but the name of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Martin written vppon it. And therefore, I per≈øwade my ≈øelfe, that they their ≈øelues are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlie ≈øo per≈øwaded, ka my nuncka Bridges, that you contemne ≈øuch kenell rakers, and ≈øcullions, as to their ≈øhame, in the time of your ≈øilence haue ≈øolde them ≈øelues for pence a peece, to be derided of come who ≈øo will, to ≈øee a companie of di≈øgui≈øed a≈ø≈øes.</p>
            <p>Concerning Mar-martin, if he be a Londoner, or an vniuer≈øitie man, tenne to one but you ≈øhall ≈øee him, one of the≈øe odde dayes, carted out of the towne for his hone≈øtie of life. Why that time of his ≈øheweth, that hee had no other bringing vppe, then in a brothel-hou≈øe. And heerein I woulde craue pardon of the vniuer≈øities, and the famous citie of London, if I ≈øhoulde bee thought to giue out, that ≈øuch a ribaulder as this is, were there maintained. To ≈øpeake what I doe thinke of the youth, I can not bee induced to thinke, that hee hath had his bringing vp at any other trade, then in carryeng long Meg of We≈øtmin≈øters hand-ba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and in attending vppon ≈øome other of his auntes, at her appointment while ≈øhee liued. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:12605:15"/>her death, it may be he hath beene promoted vnto the ≈øeruice of ≈øome laundre≈ø≈øe in a bi≈øhoppes hou≈øe, where, in hope to bee preferred by his good lordes, he hath vndertaken to mar-rimes, in publi≈øhing bawdery, and filthine≈ø≈øe, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the≈øe hone≈øt bi≈øhops.</p>
            <p>The ≈øtage-players, poore ≈øeelie hunger-≈øtarued wretches, they haue not ≈øo much as an hone≈øt calling to liue in the common-wealth: And they, poore varlets, are ≈øo ba≈øe minded, as at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of the verye≈øt rogue in England, for one poore pennie, they will be glad on open ≈øtage to play the ignominious fooles, for an houre or two together. And therfore, poore rogues, they are not ≈øo much to be blamed, if being ≈øtage-players, that is, plaine rogues (≈øaue onely for their liueries) they in the action of dealing again≈øt Mai≈øter Martin, haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them many thou≈øande eie-witne≈ø≈øes, of their wittele≈ø≈øe and pittifull conceites. And in deede they are marueilous fitte vpholders of Lambehith palace, and the crowne of Canturburie. And therefore, menne ≈øhoulde not thinke of all other things, that they ≈øhould any wayes make Mai≈øter Martin, or his ≈øonnes to alter their cour≈øe. And heereof, good Mai≈øter Canturburie, a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelfe. Well, to growe to a point with you, if you haue any of your ≈øide, eyther in the Vniuer≈øities, or in your cathedrall Churches, or any where within the compa≈ø≈øe of all the bi≈øhopdomes you haue, that dare write, or di≈øpute again≈øt anie of the≈øe pointes ≈øette downe by my father, heere I do by the≈øe my writinges, ca≈øt you downe the Gloue, in my fathers name, and the names of the re≈øt<pb facs="tcp:12605:15"/>of his ≈øonnes. If my father be gone, and none el≈øe of my brethren will vpholde the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie again≈øt you, I my ≈øelfe will doe it. And take my challenge if you dare. By writing you may do it, qand be ≈øure to be an≈øwered. By di≈øputations, if you will appoint the place, with promi≈øe, that you will not deale <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> you ≈øhall be taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo by me, if I thinke I may tru≈øt you. Otherwi≈øe, the Puritanes will, I doubt not, maintaine the chalenge again≈øt you.</p>
            <p>But heere by the way, Iohn Canturbury, take an odde aduice of your poore nephew, and that is this. Fir≈øt, in regard of your ≈øelfe, play not the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as you doe, in Gods Church; if you goe on forward in this cour≈øe, the ende will bee a wofull reckoning. Thou ha≈øt beene rai≈øed vp out of the du≈øt, and euen from the very dounghill, to bee pre≈øident of her Maie≈øties coun≈øell, being of thy ≈øelfe, a man altogether vnmeet for any ≈øuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, as neyther endued with any excellent naturall witte, nor yet with any great portion of learning. The Lorde hath pa≈ø≈øed by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands in this land farre meeter for the place then is poore Iohn Whitgift. Well then, what if thou, hauing receiued ≈øo great ble≈ø≈øings at the Lordes hand (beeing of all others in no compari≈øon anye thing neere the fitte≈øt for it, or the likelie≈øt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine it) ≈øhalt now ≈øhew thy ≈øelfe vngratefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy mercifull Lorde God, or become a cruell per≈øecutour, and a tyrant in his church, a cruell oppre≈ø≈øour of his children, ≈øhall not all that thou ha≈øt receiued, be tourned vnto a cur≈ø≈øe vnto thee, euen into thine owne bo≈øome? Yea verely. For
<pb facs="tcp:12605:16"/>the Lorde in one day is able to bring more ≈øhame vpon thee, and that in this life, then he hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ble≈ø≈øings vpon thee now for the ≈øpace of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres and vpward. But when I doe con≈øider thy preheminence and promotion, I do ≈øen≈øiblie acknowledge it to be ioyned with a rare cur≈ø≈øe of God, euen ≈øuch a cur≈ø≈øe as very fewe (I will not ≈øay none) in Gods Church doe ≈øu≈øtaine. And that is thy wicked and Antichri≈øtian Prelacie. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of which popedome of thine maketh me thinke, that thy other place in the ciuill magi≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, being in it ≈øelfe a godly and a lawfull calling, is ≈øo become infectious, that it will be thy bane, both in this life, and in the life to come. And I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt fully per≈øwaded, that, that archbi≈øhopricke of thine, together with thy practi≈øes therein, ≈øhew verely, that the Lorde hath no part nor portion in that mi≈øerabble, and de≈øperat caytiffe wicked Iohn Whitgift, the Pope of Lambehith. Leaue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both thy popedome, and thy vngodly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, or looke for a fearefull ende.</p>
            <p>My ≈øecond and la≈øt adui≈øe is this in a word. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no more of the≈øe haggling and profane pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets to be publi≈øhed again≈øt Martin, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thy hierarchie. Otherwi≈øe thou ≈øhalt but commend thy follie and ignorance vnto the world to be notorious. Mar-martin, Leonard Wright, Fregneuile, Dick Bancroft, Tom Blan. o Bedford, Kemp, Vnderhil, ≈øerue thee for no other v≈øe, but to worke thy ruine, and to bewray their owne ≈øhame, &amp; mi≈øerable ignorance. Thus far of the≈øe matters.</p>
            <p>And mee thinkes you ≈øee, nunckle Canturbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that though I bee but young, yet I beginne<pb facs="tcp:12605:16"/>prettily well to followe my fathers ≈øteppes; for I promi≈øe you, I am deceiued, vnle≈ø≈øe I haue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈ømattering gift in this Pi≈øtle-making, and I feare in a while I ≈øhall take a pride in it. I pray you, if you can, now I haue ≈øhewed you my minde, that you woulde be a meanes, that my vather, or my brethren be not offended with me for my pre≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this of mine owne head. I did all of a good meaning, to ≈øaue my fathers papers: and it would haue pitied your heart to ≈øee, how the poore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were raine and weather-beaten, euen truely in ≈øuch a ≈øort, as they coulde ≈øcant bee read to bee printed. There was neuer a drie threede in them. The≈øe ≈øea-iourneys are pittifull I perceiue. One thing me thinkes my father ≈øhould like in me, and that is, my mode≈øtie, for I haue not pre≈øumed, to publi≈øhe mine in as large a print or volume as my father doth his. Nay, I thinke it well, if I can drible out a Pi≈øtle in octauo nowe and then. Farewell, good nuncle, and pay this bearer for the cariage. Iuly 22. 1589. With as great ≈øpeede as I might.</p>
